08/16/2016 Modified the Queue class so that the put() method can be used from either
           synchronous or asynchronous code.  For example:

              from curio import Queue
              queue = Queue()

              def spam():
                  # Create some item
                  ...
                  queue.put(item)

              async def consumer():
                  while True:
                       item = await queue.get()
                       # Consume the item
                       ...

              async def coro():
                    ...
                    spam()       # Note: Normal synchronous function call
                    ...

              async def main():
                  await spawn(coro())
                  await spawn(consumer())

              run(main())

           The main purpose of adding this is to make it easier for normal
           synchronous code to communicate to async tasks without knowing
           too much about what they are.  Note:  The put() method is never
           allowed to block in synchronous mode.  If the queue has a bounded
           size and it fills up, an exception is raised.

08/16/2016 Modified the Event class so that events can also be set from synchronous
           code.  For example:

               from curio import Event
               evt = Event()

               async def coro():
                   print('Waiting for something')
                   await evt.wait()
                   print('It happened')

               # A normal synchronous function. No async/await here.
               def spam():
                   print('About to signal')
                   evt.set()

               async def main():
                   await spawn(coro())
                   await sleep(5)
                   spam()         # Note: Normal synchronous function call

               run(main())

           The main motivation for adding this is that is very easy for
           control flow to escape the world of "async/await".  However,
           that code may still want to signal or coordinate with async
           tasks in some way.   By allowing a synchronous set(), it
           makes it possible to do this.    It should be noted that within
           a coroutine, you have to use await when triggering an event.
           For example:

               evt = Event()

               def foo():
                   evt.set()           # Synchronous use

               async def bar():
                   await evt.set()     # Asynchronous use

08/04/2016 Added a new KernelExit exception that can be used to 
           make the kernel terminate execution.  For example:

              async def coro():
                  ...
                  if something_bad:
                      raise KernelExit('Something bad')

           This causes the kernel to simply stop, aborting the
           currently executing task.   The exception will propagate
           out of the run() function so if you need to catch it, do
           this:

               try:
                   run(coro())
               except KernelExit as e:
                   print('Going away because of:', e)

           KernelExit by itself does not do anything to other 
	   running tasks.  However, the run() function will
           separately issue a shutdown request causing all
           remaining tasks to cancel.

08/04/2016 Added a new TaskExit exception that can be used to make a 
           single task terminate.  For example:

               async def coro():
                   ...
                   if something_bad:
                       raise TaskExit('Goodbye')
                   ...

           Think of TaskExit as a kind of self-cancellation. 

08/04/2016 Some refinements to kernel shutdown.   The shutdown process is
           more carefully supervised and fixes a few very subtle errors
           related to task scheduling. 

07/22/2016 Added support for asynchronous access to files as might be
           opened by the builtin open() function.  Use the new aopen()
           function with an async-context manager like this:

             async with aopen(filename, 'r') as f:
                 data = await f.read()

           Note: a file opened in this manner provides an asynchronous API
           that will prevent the Curio kernel from blocking on things
           like disk seeks.  However, the underlying implementation is
           not specified.  In the initial version, thread pools are
           used to carry out each I/O operation.
           
07/18/2016 Some changes to Kernel cleanup and resource management.  The
           proper way to shut down the kernel is to use Kernel.run(shutdown=True).
           Alternatively, the kernel can now been used as a context manager:

             with Kernel() as kern:
                  kern.run(coro())

           Note: The plain run() method properly shuts down the Kernel
           if you're only running a single coroutine.

           The Kernel.__del__() method now raises an exception if the
           kernel is deleted without being properly shut down. 

06/30/2016 Added alpn_protocols keyword argument to open_connection()
           function to make it easier to use TLS ALPN with clients.  For 
           example to open a connection and have it negotiate HTTP/2 
           or HTTP/1.1 as a protocol, you can do this:

           sock = await open_connection(host, port, ssl=True, 
                                        server_hostname=host,
                                        alpn_protocols=['h2', 'http/1.1'])

           print('selected protocol:', sock.selected_alpn_protocol())

06/30/2016 Changed internal clock handling to use absolute values of
           the monotonic clock.  New wakeat() function utilizes this
           to allow more controlled sleeping for periodic timers
           and other applications.  For example, here is a loop that
           precisely wakes up on a specified time interval:

           import time
           from curio import wakeat

           async def pulse(interval):
               next_wake = time.monotonic()
               while True:
                    await wake_at(next_wake)
                    print('Tick', time.asctime())
                    next_wake += interval
                
06/16/2016 Fixed Issue #55.  Exceptions occuring in code executed by 
           run_in_process() now include a RemoteTraceback exception 
           that shows the traceback from the remote process. This
           should make debugging a big easier. 

06/11/2016 Fixed Issue #53.  curio.run() was swallowing all exceptions.  It now
           reports a TaskError exception if the given coroutine fails.  This is
           a chained exception where __cause__ contains the actual cause of
           failure.   This is meant to be consistent with the join() method 
           of Tasks.

06/09/2016 Experimental new wait() function added.  It can be used to wait for
           more than one task at a time and to return them in completion order.
           For example:

           task1 = await spawn(coro())
           task2 = await spawn(coro())
           task3 = await spawn(coro())

           # Get results from all tasks as they complete
           async for task in wait([task1, task2, task3]):
               result = await task.join()

           # Get the first result and cancel remaining tasks
           async with wait([task1, task2, task3]) as w:
               task = await w.next_done()
               result = await task.join()
               # Other tasks cancelled here

06/09/2016 Refined the behavior of timeouts.  First, a timeout is not allowed
           to extend the time expiration of a previously set timeout. For
           example, if code previously set a 5 second timeout, an attempt
           to now set a 10 second timeout still results in a 5 second timeout.
           Second, when restoring a previous timeout, if the timeout period has
           expired, Curio arranges for a TaskTimeout exception to be raised on
           the next blocking call.   Without this, it's too easy for timeouts
           to disappear or not have any effect.   Setting a timeout of None
           disables timeouts regardless of any prior setting.

06/07/2016 Changed trap names (e.g., '_trap_io') to int enums. This is
           low-level change that shouldn't affect existing code.

05/23/2016 Fixed Issue #52 (Problem with ignore_after context manager).
           There was a possibility that a task would be marked for
           timeout at precisely the same time some other operation had
           completed and the task was sitting on the ready queue. To fix,
           the timeout is deferred and retried the next time the kernel
           blocks. 

05/20/2016 Added asyncobject class to curio/meta.py.  This allows you
           to write classes with an asynchronous __init__ method. For example:

           from curio.meta import asyncobject
           class Spam(asyncobject):
               async def __init__(self):
                   ...
                   self.value = await coro()
                   ...

           Instances can only be created via await.  For example:

              s = await Spam()

05/15/2016 Fixed Issue #50. Undefined variable n in io.py 
	   Reported by Wolfgang Langner

Version 0.4 : May 13, 2016
--------------------------
05/13/2016 Fixed a subtle bug with futures/cancellation.

Version 0.3 : May 13, 2016
--------------------------
05/13/2016 Bug fixes to the run_in_process() and run_in_thread() 
           functions so that exceptions are reported properly.
           Also fixed logic bug on related to kernel task initialization.

05/13/2016 Modification to the abide() function to allow it to work
           with RLocks from the threading module.  One caveat: Such
	   locks are NOT reentrant from within curio itself. 

Version 0.2 : May 11, 2016
--------------------------
05/05/2016 Refactoring of stream I/O classes. There is now FileStream
           and SocketStream.   The old Stream class is gone.

04/30/2016 The run_blocking() and run_cpu_bound() calls are now
           called run_in_thread() and run_in_process().

04/23/2016 Changed the new_task() function to spawn().

04/22/2016 Removed parent/child task relationship and associated
           tracking.  It's an added complexity that's not really
	   needed in the kernel and it can be done easily enough by
	   the user in cases where it might be needed.

04/18/2016 Major refactoring of timeout handling.  Virtually all
           operations in curio support cancellation and timeouts.
           However, putting an explicit "timeout" argument on
           every API function/method greatly complicates the 
           underlying implementation (and introduces performance
           overhead in cases where timeouts aren't used). To
           put a timeout on an operation, use the timeout_after()
           function instead.  For example:

               await timeout_after(5, sock.recv(1024))

           This will cause a timeout to be raised after the
           specified time interval.  

04/01/2016 Improved management of the I/O selector.  The number of
           register/unregister operations are reduced for tasks 
           that constantly perform I/O on the same resources.  This
           could offer a nice performance boost in certain cases.

03/31/2016 Switched test suite to py.test. All of the tests are in the
           top-level tests directory.  Use 'python3 -m pytest' to test.

03/30/2016 Improved the curio monitor.  Instead of relying on the
           console TTY (and invoked via Ctrl-C), it now uses a socket
           to which you must connect via a different session. To
           enable the monitor either use:

               kernel = Kernel(with_monitor=True)

           or run with an environment variable

               env CURIOMONITOR=TRUE python3 yourprogram.py

           To connect to the monitor, use the following command:

               python3 -m curio.monitor
          
02/15/2016 Fixed Issue #37 where scheduling multiple tasks for sleeping
           could potentially cause a crash in rare circumstances.

Version 0.1 : October 31, 2015
