CHANGES
-------
04/30/2016 The run_blocking() and run_cpu_bound() calls are now
           called run_in_thread() and run_in_process().

04/23/2016 Changed the new_task() function to spawn().

04/22/2016 Removed parent/child task relationship and associated
           tracking.  It's an added complexity that's not really
	   needed in the kernel and it can be done easily enough by
	   the user in cases where it might be needed.

04/18/2016 Major refactoring of timeout handling.  Virtually all
           operations in curio support cancellation and timeouts.
           However, putting an explicit "timeout" argument on
           every API function/method greatly complicates the 
           underlying implementation (and introduces performance
           overhead in cases where timeouts aren't used). To
           put a timeout on an operation, use the timeout_after()
           function instead.  For example:

               await timeout_after(5, sock.recv(1024))

           This will cause a timeout to be raised after the
           specified time interval.  

04/01/2016 Improved management of the I/O selector.  The number of
           register/unregister operations are reduced for tasks 
           that constantly perform I/O on the same resources.  This
           could offer a nice performance boost in certain cases.

03/31/2016 Switched test suite to py.test. All of the tests are in the
           top-level tests directory.  Use 'python3 -m pytest' to test.

03/30/2016 Improved the curio monitor.  Instead of relying on the
           console TTY (and invoked via Ctrl-C), it now uses a socket
           to which you must connect via a different session. To
           enable the monitor either use:

               kernel = Kernel(with_monitor=True)

           or run with an environment variable

               env CURIOMONITOR=TRUE python3 yourprogram.py

           To connect to the monitor, use the following command:

               python3 -m curio.monitor
          
02/15/2016 Fixed Issue #37 where scheduling multiple tasks for sleeping
           could potentially cause a crash in rare circumstances.
