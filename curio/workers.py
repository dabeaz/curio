    The worker process is created using multiprocessing.Process().
    Communication with the process uses multiprocessing.Pipe() and an
    asynchronous message passing channel.  All function arguments and
    return values are seralized using the pickle module.  When
    cancelled, the Process.terminate() method is used to kill the
    worker process.  This results in a SIGTERM signal being sent to
    the process.

    The handle_cancellation flag, if True, indicates that you intend
    to manage the worker cancellation yourself.  This an advanced
    option.  Any resulting CancelledError has 'task' and 'worker'
    attributes.  task is a background task that's supervising the
    still executing work.  worker is the associated process.

    The worker process is a separate isolated Python interpreter.
    Nothing should be assumed about its global state including shared
    variables, files, or connections.

# Pool of workers for carrying out jobs on behalf of curio tasks.
#
# This pool works a bit differently than a normal thread/process
# pool due to some of the different ways that threads get used in Curio.
# Instead of submitting work to the pool, you use the reserve() method
# to obtain a worker:
#
#     worker = await pool.reserve()
#
# Once you have a worker, it is yours for as long as you want to have
# it.  To submit work to it, use the apply() method:
#
#     await worker.apply(callable, args, kwargs)
#
# When you're done with it, release it back to the pool.
#
#     await worker.release()
#
# Some rationale for this design:  Sometimes when you're working with
# threads, you want to perform multiple steps and you need to make sure
# you're performing each step on the same thread for some reason. This
# is especially true if you're trying to manage work cancellation.
# For example, work started in a thread might need to be cleaned up
# on the same thread.  By reserving/releasing workers, we get more
# control over the whole process of how workers get managed.

# Support for blocking in threads.  
#
# Discussion:
#
# The run_in_thread() function can be used to run any synchronous function
# in a separate thread.  However, certain kinds of operations are
# inherently unsafe.   For example, consider a worker task that wants
# to wait on a threading Event like this:
#
#    evt = threading.Event()     # Foreign Event...
# 
#    async def worker():
#        await run_in_thread(evt.wait)
#        print('Alive!')
#
# Now suppose Curio spins up a huge number of workers:
#
#    for n in range(1000):
#        await spawn(worker())
#
# At this point, you're in a bad situation.  The worker tasks have
# all called run_in_thread() and are blocked indefinitely.  Because
# the pool of worker threads is limited, you've exhausted all
# available resources.  Nobody call run_in_thread() without blocking.
# There's a pretty good chance that your code is permanently deadlocked.
# There are dark clouds.
#
# This problem can be solved by wrapping run_in_thread() with a 
# semaphore. Like this:
#
#    _barrier = curio.Semaphore()
#
#    async def worker():
#        async with _barrier:
#            await run_in_thread(evt.wait)
#
# However, to make it much more convenient, we can take care of
# a lot of fiddly details.  We can cache the requested callable,
# build a set of semaphores and synchronize things in the background.
# That's what the block_in_thread() function is doing.  For example:
#
#    async def worker():
#        await block_in_thread(evt.wait)
#        print('Alive!')
#
# Unlike run_in_thread(), spawning up 1000 workers creates a 
# situation where only 1 worker is actually blocked in a thread.
# The other 999 workers are blocked on a semaphore waiting for service.
