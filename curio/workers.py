    occurs, the associated worker thread will continue to run until
    completion as a kind of zombie.  When this happens, the cancelled
    worker will be immediately replaced by a new worker thread that's
    able to process further requests.  The cancelled worker thread
    will terminate when the callable completes its work (the result is
    discarded in that case).

    have a bound on their execution time (e.g., timeout or some

    The worker process is created using multiprocessing.Process().
    Communication with the process uses multiprocessing.Pipe() and an
    asynchronous message passing channel.  All function arguments and
    return values are seralized using the pickle module.  When
    cancelled, the Process.terminate() method is used to kill the
    worker process.  This results in a SIGTERM signal being sent to
    the process.

    The worker process is a separate isolated Python interpreter.
    Nothing should be assumed about its global state including shared
    variables, files, or connections.
