# curio/local.py
#
# Task local storage

__all__ = ["Local"]

# Our public API is intentionally almost identical to that of threading.local:
# the user allocates a curio.Local() object, and then can attach arbitrary
# attributes to it. Reading one of these attributes later will return the last
# value that was assigned to this attribute *by code running inside the same
# Task*.
#
# Internally, each Task has an attribute .task_local_storage, which holds a
# dict. This dict has one entry for each Local object that has been accessed
# from this task context (i.e. entries here are lazily allocated), keyed by
# the Local object instance itself:
#
#   {
#     local_object_1: {
#       "attr": value,
#       "attr": value,
#       ...
#     },
#     local_object_2: {
#       "attr": value,
#       "attr": value,
#       ...
#     },
#     ...
#   }
#
# From an async context one could access this dict with
#
#  (await curio.current_task()).task_local_storage
#
# But, we also want to be able to access this from synchronous context,
# because one of the major use cases for this is tagging log messages with
# context, and there are lots of legacy third-party libraries that use the
# Python stdlib logging module. And it's synchronous. So if you want to
# capture their logs and feed them into something better and more context-ful,
# then you need to be able to get that context from synchronous-land.
#
# Therefore, whenever we resume a task, we stash a pointer to its
# .task_local_storage dictionary in a global *thread*-local variable. Then
# when we want to find a specific variable (local_obj.attr), we ultimately
# look in
#
#  _current_task_local_storage.value[local_obj]["attr"]
#
# An unusual feature of this implementation (and our main deviation from
# threading.Local) is that we implement *task local inheritance*, i.e., when you
# spawn a new task, then all task local values set in the parent task are (shallowly)
# copied to the child task. This is a bit experimental, but very handy in
# cases like when a request handler spawns some small short-lived worker tasks
# as part of its processing and those want to do logging as well.
