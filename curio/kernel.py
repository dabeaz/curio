                    # When a task performs I/O, it registers itself with the underlying
                    # I/O selector.  When the task is reawakened, it unregisters itself
                    # and prepares to run.  However, in many network applications, the
                    # task will perform a small amount of work and then go to sleep on
                    # exactly the same I/O resource that it was waiting on before. For
                    # example, a client handling task in a server will often spend most
                    # of its time waiting for incoming data on a single socket.
                    #
                    # Instead of always unregistering the task from the selector, we
                    # can defer the unregistration process until after the task goes
                    # back to sleep again.  If it happens to be sleeping on the same
                    # resource as before, there's no need to unregister it--it will
                    # still be registered from the last I/O operation.
                    #
                    # The code here performs the unregister step for a task that
                    # ran, but is now sleeping for a *different* reason than repeating the
