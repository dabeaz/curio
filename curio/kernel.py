# curio/kernel.py
#
# Main execution kernel.
#
# Curio is based on a few overarching design principles that drive the code
# you'll find here.
#
# 1. Environmental Isolation.
#
#    Curio strictly separates the environment of async and synchronous
#    programming.  All functionality related to async operation is
#    placed in async-function definitions.  Async functions request
#    the services of the kernel using low-level yield statements
#    (traps).  The kernel is an opaque black-box from the perspective
#    of synchronous code.  There is only one available
#    operation--run(coro) which runs a new task.  There are no other
#    mechanisms available for interacting with the kernel from
#    synchronous code.  A good analogy might be the distinction
#    between user and protected mode in an OS.  User programs run in
#    user-mode and the operating system kernel runs in protected mode.
#    The same thing happens here.  User programs in Curio can only run
#    in async functions. Those programs can request the services of
#    the kernel. However, they're not granted any further access than
#    that (there is no API surface or anything that can be used).
#
# 2. Microkernels
#
#    The low-level kernel is meant to be small, fast, and minimally
#    featureful.  In fact, almost nothing interesting happens in the
#    kernel. Instead, almost every useful part of Curio gets
#    implemented in async functions found elsewhere.  If you're trying
#    to add new features to Curio, don't add them to the kernel. Think
#    about how to create objects and functions that operate at the
#    async-function level instead.  See files such as sync.py or
#    queue.py for examples.
#
# 3. Decoupling
#
#    No part of Curio has direct linkage to the Kernel class (it's
#    not imported or used anywhere else in the code base).   If you want,
#    you can make a completely custom Kernel object and have the
#    rest of Curio run on it.  You just need to make sure you implement
#    the required traps.   This is in contrast to libraries such as
#    asyncio where many parts of the implementation are required to
#    carry a reference to the underlying event loop.
