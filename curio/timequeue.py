#
# A Discussion About Time.
# 
# Internally, Curio must manage time for two different reasons,
# sleeping and for timeouts.  Aside from toy examples, most people
# aren't going to write that code sits around sleeping. Instead,
# the more common use is timeouts.  Timeouts are kind of 
# interesting though--when a timeout is set, there is a general
# expectation that it will probably NOT fire.  The firing of a timeout
# is an exceptional event. Most of the time, a timeout will be
# cancelled before it is allowed to expire.
#
# This presents an interesting implementation challenge for managing
# time.  It is most common to see time managed by sorting different
# expiration times in some way. For example, placing them in a sorted
# list, or ordering them on a heap in a priority queue.  Although
# operations on these structures can often be managed in O(log N) time,
# they might not be necessary at all if you make some different
# assumptions about time management.
# 
# The queue implementation here is based on the idea that expiration
# times in the distant future don't really need to be precisely
# sorted.  Instead, you can merely drop expiration times into
# different buckets, representing different time periods in the
# future.  If later cancelled, you can delete the time from a bucket.
# This can all be managed using simple dictionaries.  Thus,
# manipulating the buckets is O(1)--meaning it can be extremely cheap
# to setup and teardown a timeout that never happens.  For expiration
# times that aren't cancelled, they slowly cascade forward, eventually
# becoming sorted as the deadline approaches.  Probably the closest
# similar thing might the implementation of Timing Wheels (e.g., as
# used in the Linux kernel).
#
# One unusual aspect to the implementation is that to better manage
# timeouts, it's better to allow time to more slowly creep along in an
# incremental manner than to make large jumps.  For example, suppose a
# collection of tasks have all set timeouts 5 minutes into the future.
# When polling for I/O, you might be inclined to find the nearest
# deadline and pass that to select() (something close to 5 minutes).
# The only problem with this approach is that you'll have to sort all
# of the deadlines to figure it out (which kind of defeats the
# purpose).  Instead of doing that, it's better to operate with a more
# narrow window.  For example, are there any deadlines that expire in
# the next second?  If so, go ahead and use them.  Otherwise, just 
# put a one-second timeout on select().
