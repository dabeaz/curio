Curio How-To
============

This document provides some recipes for using Curio to perform common tasks.

How do you write a simple TCP server?
-------------------------------------

Here is an example of a simple TCP echo server::

    from curio import run, spawn, tcp_server

    async def echo_client(client, addr):
        print('Connection from', addr)
        while True:
            data = await client.recv(100000)
            if not data:
                break
            await client.sendall(data)
        print('Connection closed')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run(tcp_server('', 25000, echo_client))

This server uses sockets directly.  If you want to a use a file-like streams
interface, use the ``as_stream()`` method like this::

    from curio import run, spawn, tcp_server

    async def echo_client(client, addr):
        print('Connection from', addr)
        s = client.as_stream()
        while True:
            data = await s.read(100000)
            if not data:
                break
            await s.write(data)
        print('Connection closed')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run(tcp_server('', 25000, echo_client))

How do you write a UDP Server?
------------------------------

Here is an example of a simple UDP echo server using sockets::

    import curio
    from curio import socket

    async def udp_echo(addr):
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
        sock.bind(addr)
        while True:
            data, addr = await sock.recvfrom(10000)
            print('Received from', addr, data)
            await sock.sendto(data, addr)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        curio.run(main(('', 26000)))

At this time, there are no high-level function (i.e., similar to
``tcp_server()``) to run a UDP server. 

How do you perform a blocking operation?
----------------------------------------

If you need to perform a blocking operation that runs outside of curio,
use ``run_in_thread()`` to have it run in a backing thread.  For example::

    import time
    import curio

    result = await curio.run_in_thread(time.sleep, 100)

How do you perform a CPU intensive operation?
---------------------------------------------

If you need to run a CPU-intensive operation, you can either run it in
a thread (see above) or have it run in a separate process. For
example::

    import curio

    def fib(n):
        if n <= 2:
           return 1
        else:
           return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

    ...
    result = await curio.run_in_process(fib, 40)

Note: Since the operation in question runs in a separate interpreter,
it should not involve any shared state.  Make sure you pass all
required information in the function's input arguments.

How do you apply a timeout?
---------------------------

You can make any curio operation timeout using ``timeout_after(seconds, coro)``. For
example::

    from curio import timeout_after, TaskTimeout
    try:
         result = await timeout_after(5, coro(args))
    except TaskTimeout:
         print('Timed out')

Since wrapping a timeout in an exception is common, you can also use ``ignore_after()``
which returns ``None`` instead.  For example::

    from curio import ignore_after

    result = await ignore_after(5, coro(args))
    if result is None:
        print('Timeout out')

How can a timeout be applied to a block of statements?
------------------------------------------------------

Use the ``timeout_after()`` or ``ignore_after()`` functions as a context
manager.  For example::

    async with timeout_after(5):
         statement1
         statement2
         ...

This is a cumulative timeout applied to the entire block.   After the 
specified number of seconds has elapsed, a ``TaskTimeout`` exception
will be raised in the current operation blocking in curio.

How do you shield operations from timeouts or cancellation?
-----------------------------------------------------------

To protect a block of statements from being aborted due to a timeout or
cancellation, use ``disable_cancellation()`` as a context manager like this::

     async def func():
         ...
         async with disable_cancellation():
             await coro1()
             await coro2()
             ...

         await blocking_op()      # Cancellation delivered here


How can tasks communicate?
--------------------------

Similar to threads, one of the easiest ways to communicate between
tasks is to use a queue.  For example::

    import curio

    async def producer(queue):
        for n in range(10):
            await queue.put(n)
        await queue.join()
        print('Producer done')

    async def consumer(queue):
        while True:
            item = await queue.get()
            print('Consumer got', item)
            await queue.task_done()

    async def main():
        q = curio.Queue()
        prod_task = await curio.spawn(producer(q))
        cons_task = await curio.spawn(consumer(q))
        await prod_task.join()
        await cons_task.cancel()

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        curio.run(main())


How can a task and a thread communicate?
----------------------------------------

The most straightforward way to communicate between curio tasks and
threads is to use curio's ``UniversalQueue`` class::

    import curio
    import threading

    # A thread - standard python
    def producer(queue):
        for n in range(10):
            queue.put(n)
        queue.join()
        print('Producer done')

    # A task - Curio
    async def consumer(queue):
        while True:
            item = await queue.get()
            print('Consumer got', item)
            await queue.task_done()

    async def main():
        q = curio.UniversalQueue()
        prod_task = threading.Thread(target=producer, args=(q,)).start()
        cons_task = await curio.spawn(consumer(q))
        await run_in_thread(prod_task.join)
        await cons_task.cancel()

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        curio.run(main())

A ``UniversalQueue`` can be used by any combination of threads or
curio tasks.  The same API is used in both cases.  However,
when working with coroutines, queue operations must be
prefaced by an ``await`` keyword.

How can coroutines and threads share a common lock?
---------------------------------------------------

A lock can be shared if the lock in question is one from the
``threading`` module and you use the curio ``abide()`` function.  For
example::

    import threading
    import curio

    lock = threading.Lock()      # Must be a thread-lock

    # Function running in a thread
    def func():
        ...
        with lock:
             critical_section
             ...

    # Coroutine running curio
    async def coro():
        ...
        async with curio.abide(lock):
             critical_section
             ...

``curio.abide()`` adapts the given lock to work safely inside
curio.  If given a thread-lock, the various locking operations
are executed in threads to avoid blocking other curio tasks. 

How do you run external commands in a subprocess?
-------------------------------------------------

Curio provides it's own version of the subprocess module.  Use
the ``check_output()`` function as you would in normal Python code.
For example::

    from curio import subprocess

    async def func():
        ...
        out = await subprocess.check_output(['cmd','arg1','arg2','arg3'])
        ...

The ``check_output()`` function takes the same arguments and raises the
same exceptions as its standard library counterpart.  The underlying 
implementation is built entirely using the async I/O primitives of curio.
It's fast and no backing threads are used. 

How can you communicate with a subprocess over a pipe?
------------------------------------------------------
Use the ``curio.subprocess`` module just like you would use the
normal ``subprocess`` module. For example::

    from curio import subprocess

    async def func():
         ...
         p = subprocess.Popen(['cmd', 'arg1', 'arg2', ...],
                              stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
                              stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
         await p.stdin.write(b'Some data')
         ...
         resp = await p.stdout.read(maxsize)

In this example, the ``p.stdin`` and ``p.stdout`` streams are
replaced by curio-compatible file streams.  You use the same
I/O operations as before, but make sure you preface them
with ``await``. 

How does a coroutine get its enclosing Task instance?
-----------------------------------------------------

Use the ``current_task()`` function like this::

     from curio import current_task
     ...
     async def func():
         ...
         myself = await current_task()
         ...

Once you have a reference to the ``Task``, it can be passed
around and use in other operations.  For example, a different
task could use it to cancel.
