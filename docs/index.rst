Curio
=====

- a small and unusual object that is considered interesting or attractive
- A Python library for concurrent I/O and systems programming.

Curio is a library for performing concurrent I/O and common system
programming tasks such as launching subprocesses and farming work
out to thread and process pools.  It uses Python coroutines and the
explicit async/await syntax introduced in Python 3.5.  Its programming
model is based on cooperative multitasking and existing programming
abstractions such as threads, sockets, files, subprocesses, locks, and
queues.  You'll find it to be small and fast.

Installation:
-------------

Curio requires Python 3.5 and Unix.  You can install it using ``pip``::

    bash % python3 -m pip install curio

or better install a fresh version from git::

    pip install git+https://github.com/dabeaz/curio.git

An Example
----------
Here is a simple TCP echo server implemented using sockets and curio::

    # echoserv.py
    
    from curio import run, spawn
    from curio.socket import *
    
    async def echo_server(address):
        sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
        sock.bind(address)
        sock.listen(5)
        print('Server listening at', address)
        async with sock:
            while True:
                client, addr = await sock.accept()
                await spawn(echo_client(client, addr))
    
    async def echo_client(client, addr):
        print('Connection from', addr)
        async with client:
             while True:
                 data = await client.recv(100000)
                 if not data:
                     break
                 await client.sendall(data)
        print('Connection closed')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run(echo_server(('',25000)))

If you have programmed with threads, you'll find that curio looks similar.
You'll also find that the above server can handle thousands of simultaneous 
client connections even though no threads are being used under the covers.

Of course, if you prefer something a little higher level, you can have
curio take of the fiddly bits related to setting up the server portion
of the code::

    # echoserv.py

    from curio import run, tcp_server

    async def echo_client(client, addr):
        print('Connection from', addr)
        while True:
            data = await client.recv(100000)
            if not data:
                break
            await client.sendall(data)
        print('Connection closed')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run(tcp_server('', 25000, echo_client))

This is only a small sample of what's possible.  The `tutorial 
<https://curio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html>`_ is a good starting point
for more information.

Additional Features
-------------------

Curio provides additional support for SSL connections, synchronization
primitives (events, locks, semaphores, and condition variables),
queues, Unix signals, subprocesses, as well as running tasks in
threads and processes. The task model fully supports cancellation,
timeouts, monitoring, and other features critical to writing reliable
code.

The Big Question: Why?
----------------------

Python already has a variety of libraries for async and event driven
I/O. So, why create yet another library?  There is no simple answer to
that question, but here are a few of the motivations for creating curio.

* Python 3 has evolved considerably as a programming language and has
  adopted many new language features that are well-suited to cleanly
  writing a library like this. For example, improved support for
  non-blocking I/O, support for delegation to subgenerators (`yield
  from`) and the introduction of explicit `async` and `await` syntax
  in Python 3.5. Curio takes full advantage of these features and is
  not encumbered by issues of backwards compatibility with legacy
  Python code written 15 years ago.

* Existing I/O libraries are mainly built on event-loops, callback
  functions, and abstractions that predate Python's proper support for
  coroutines.  As a result, they are either overly complicated or
  dependent on esoteric magic involving C extensions, monkeypatching,
  or reimplementing half of the TCP flow-control protocol.  Curio is a
  ground-up implementation that takes a different approach to the
  problem while relying upon known programming techniques involving
  sockets and files.  If you have previously written synchronous code
  using processes or threads, curio will feel familiar.  That is by
  design.

* Simplicity is an important part of writing reliable systems
  software.  When your code fails, it helps to be able to debug
  it--possibly down to the level of individual calls to the operating
  system if necessary. Simplicity matters a lot.  Simple code also
  tends to run faster. The implementation of Curio aims to be simple.
  The API for using Curio aims to be intuitive.

* It's fun. 


Under the Covers
----------------

Internally, curio is implemented entirely as a task queuing system--
much in the same model of a microkernel based operating system.  Tasks
are represented by coroutine functions declared with the `async`
keyword.  Each yield of a coroutine results in a low-level kernel
"trap" or system call.  The kernel handles each trap by moving the
current task to an appropriate waiting queue. Events (i.e., due to
I/O) and other operations make the tasks move from waiting queues back
into service.

It's important to emphasize that the underlying kernel is solely
focused on task queuing and scheduling. In fact, the kernel doesn't
even perform any I/O operations or do much of anything.  This means
that it is very small and fast.

Higher-level I/O operations are carried out by a wrapper layer that
uses Python's normal socket and file objects. You use the
same operations that you would normally use in synchronous code except
that you add ``await`` keywords to methods that might block.

Questions and Answers
---------------------

**Q: Is curio implemented using the asyncio module?**

A: No. Curio is a standalone library. Although the core of the library
uses the same basic machinery as ``asyncio`` to poll for I/O events,
the handling of those events is carried out in a completely different
manner.

**Q: Is curio meant to be a clone of asyncio?**

A: No.  Although curio provides a significant amount of overlapping
functionality, the API is different and smaller.  Compatibility with
other libaries is not a goal.

**Q: How many tasks can be created?**

A: Each task involves an instance of a ``Task`` class that
encapsulates a generator. No threads are used. As such, you're really
only limited by the memory of your machine--potentially you could have
hundreds of thousands of tasks.  The I/O functionality in curio is
implemented using the built-in ``selectors`` module.  Thus, the number
of open sockets allowed would be subject to the limits of that library
combined with any per-user limits imposed by the operating system.
 
**Q: Can curio interoperate with other event loops?**

A: At this time, no.  However, curio is a young project. It's
something that might be added later.

**Q: How fast is curio?**

A: In rough benchmarking of the simple echo server shown here, Curio
runs between 75-150% faster than comparable code using coroutines in
``asyncio``, 5-40% faster than the same coroutines running on
``uvloop`` (an alternative event-loop for ``asyncio``), and at about
the same speed as gevent.  This is on OS-X so your mileage might
vary. Curio is not as fast as servers that utilize threads, low-level
callback-based event handling (e.g., low-level protocols in
``asyncio``), or direct coding in assembly language.  However, those
approaches also don't involve coroutines (which is the whole point of
Curio). See the ``examples/benchmark`` directory of the distribution
for various testing programs.

**Q: Is curio going to evolve into a framework?**

A: No. The current goal is merely to provide a small, simple library
for performing concurrent I/O, task synchronization, and common
systems operations involving interprocess communication and
subprocesses. It is not anticipated that curio itself would evolve
into a framework for implementing application level protocols such as
HTTP.  However, it might serve as a foundation for other packages that
want to provide that kind of functionality.

**Q: What are future plans?**

A: Future work on curio will primarily focus on features related to
performance, debugging, diagnostics, and reliability.  A main goal is
to provide a robust environment for running and controlling concurrent
tasks.

**Q: How big is curio?**

A: The complete library currently consists of fewer than 2500 lines of
source statements.  This does not include blank lines and comments.

**Q: Can I contribute?**

A: Absolutely. Please use the Github page at
https://github.com/dabeaz/curio as the primary point of discussion
concerning pull requests, bugs, and feature requests.
